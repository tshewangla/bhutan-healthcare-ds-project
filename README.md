“Bhutan Healthcare Data Science Group Project”

Bhutan Life Expectancy Analysis & Prediction

Data Science Group Project – Completed by Group 1.

This project analyses life expectancy trends in Bhutan from 2000–2021 using official WHO data.
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and deployment using a fully interactive Streamlit web app.

It follows a complete data science workflow:

Data collection

Data cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Machine learning modeling

Model evaluation

Deployment using Streamlit

Tshewang Dorji —  Primary Developer

Tshewang coordinated the entire project and was responsible for the majority of the technical implementation.
He handled:

Setting up the GitHub repository and folder structure

Integrating all Google Colab work into the repository

Cleaning and validating the final datasets

Conducting detailed EDA and statistical summaries

Performing feature engineering

Developing and training the machine learning model

Saving and documenting the final model

Building and deploying the full Streamlit web application

Writing the main documentation, README, and final report sections

Tshewang ensured the entire project was consistent, technically sound, and aligned with the assignment requirements.

Rinzin — Data Cleaning Contributor (Google Colab)

Rinzin examined the raw WHO dataset in Google Colab, reviewed missing values, and contributed notes regarding:

data types

early cleaning considerations

identification of the relevant life expectancy indicator

These insights helped shape the early cleaning steps before the full integration by Tshewang.


Jamyang — EDA Contributor (Google Colab)

Jamyang assisted with the Exploratory Data Analysis by contributing:

interpretations of line-chart patterns

descriptive insights on male/female life expectancy differences

suggestions for additional plots such as confidence interval visualisations

These conceptual notes were incorporated into the final EDA notebook.

Yuden — Modeling Insights Contributor (Google Colab)

Yuden supported the modeling process by providing:

interpretation of RMSE and R² results

comments on why RandomForestRegressor was suitable

observations on the trend-based nature of life expectancy data

These insights strengthened the explanation in the modeling section.

Tenzin — UI & Documentation Support

Tenzin contributed wording improvements for:

Streamlit interface section titles

sidebar navigation wording

user-friendly descriptions inside the app

proofreading the README and documentation structure

These edits helped improve clarity and presentation quality.
